# URL Shortener API

![Alt text](/frontend/public/picnicproj.png 'screenshot')

This is a prototype of a full-stack URL Shortener application, using FastAPI and
React.

### üîß Setup:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and Python installed
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/georgemarsh1809/PicnicProject`
3. For the Back End:
    - From the root directory, navigate to the backend folder: `cd backend`
    - Create and activate virtual environment:
        - Create: (On Mac) `python3 -m venv .venv` (on Windows, change `python3`
          to `python`)
        - Activate: `source .venv/bin/activate` (on Windows,
          `.venv\Scripts\activate`)
    - Install dependencies:
        - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (may have to change `pip3` to `pip`
          on Windows)
    - Run the FastAPI server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

-   It should be available at: http://localhost:8000

4. For the Front End:
    - From the root directory, navigate to the frontend folder: `cd frontend`
    - In `/frontend/`, run `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies
    - Then, run `npm run dev` to start the React app. Open the prompted URL to
      check the FE renders.

-   It should run on: http://localhost:5173 (or similar, depending on Vite
    config)

##

### üß™ To Run The Tests:

1. Make sure you have `pytest`, `httpx (v0.24.1)`, and `fastapi` installed. \
   They should have installed when you ran `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. \
    If not, run: `pip3 install fastapi pytest httpx==0.24.1 `
2. Navigate to the backend folder: \
   `cd backend`
3. Simply run: `pytest`

### Implementation Notes

#### üìã Project Requirements :

"Please build a simple API with:

1. `POST /shorten` ‚Äì Accepts a long URL, returns a shortened one (e.g.,
   https://pic.ni/abc123)
2. `GET /{code} `‚Äì Redirects to the original long URL
3. Basic persistence between requests (e.g., save data to a file or use SQLite)"

##

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tech:

-   I built the solution using FastAPI, a Python based API development
    framework, for its simplicity and ease of setup and configuration.
-   I also built a simple UI using React for its easy implementation, and to
    highlight my proficiency with JavaScript/HTML/CSS.

##

#### üìú Assumptions:

-   This is a test of my ability to interpret requirements and implement a REST
    API, not of my ability to create a custom hashing algorithm. Considering
    this, I utilised an external hashing module, `hashids.py`, to convert the
    IDs to short, unique codes. In the future, a custom hashing process could be
    implemented for further control and customisation.

-   The base URL doesn't necessarily impact the integrity of the solution: it's
    displayed as https://pic.ni/{code} for consistency with the requirements,
    but its only the code which is relevant. Of course, when hosted locally, the
    base URL is `https://localhost:8000`, but in production, this could be set
    to anything.

##

#### üìä Data Storage

-   The stored URLs are added to a JSON file, each with a unique ID (int), which
    is used to generate a unique 6 character code, which can be used in a `GET`
    request to redirect to the original long URL. The long URL to be shortened
    is parsed to the `/shorten` endpoint via the request body. Even though this
    isn't as practical (can't be simply tested in the URL bar in browser; I use
    Postman to test), I decided this over parsing it as a query parameter for a
    few reasons:

    -   Parsing as a query param requires careful URL encoding for special
        characters
    -   Doesn't scale well if more params are to be added (expiry time, creation
        date etc.)
    -   Query parameters are less secure (in the case of sensitive URLs)
    -   There's an inherit URL length limit of 2000 characters for most browsers

##

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Interesting Problems I Faced With This Project:

-   At one point, I was having an interesting issue of duplicate URLs being
    added. I was sure that the problem was to do with the comparison statement
    in `services.py`, where the incoming `newUrl` was being compared to each url
    in the JSON store: `if newUrl == code['url']`. My intuition was telling me
    that the issue was related to the Type of each operand being different. To
    debug: After some printing of Types and values, I could see the values were
    the same, but the types were in fact different. The URL from the JSON store,
    `code['url']`, is a string, but incoming `newUrl`, as defined in the
    function arguments, is of type `AnyHttpUrl`. I did some research, and found
    out that when these are compared, even when the values are the same, it
    returns false. I resolved this by wrapping the incoming data with the
    `str()` method; `str(newUrl)` so they were both the same Type. This
    immediately solved the problem and dupes were not being added.

-   After initially implementing the Frontend and the `POST` API call to add a
    new URL, even with hard-coded, static data (e.g. "https://example.com") as
    the body of the request, I was getting a CORS error, which was throwing a
    HTTP response of `422 Unprocessable Content`. This confused me since I had
    just explicitly implemented the Type of the payload to be of `AnyHttpUrl`
    from Pydantic, to ensure that the format of the URL was valid. I was also
    slightly concerned since I know how much of a pain CORS errors are to fix.
    To debug, I did some research to ensure the structure of the body for `POST`
    requests in React (JavaScript) was correct ‚Üí It was here I learned that you
    have to include a request header, `{ 'Content-Type': 'application/json', }`,
    to tell FastAPI that JSON is being sent, so it can be handled appropriately.
    I included the header in the request, and from here I was able to add new
    URLs, which then immediately updated in the UI.

-   Initially I was returning a RedirectResponse for the `GET` request, but once
    I implemented the UI, I was getting a strange browser error, where the
    redirect was returned inside the fetch, but the browser didn't update. To
    fix this, I changed the return of the call to a JSONResponse, which included
    a string of the longUrl associated with the `302 Found` response code. The
    redirect is then handled with React (if the res.status is not 302 after the
    call, an error is thrown). When simply testing the `GET` call with the
    browser using `https://localhost:8000/{code}`, it loads the appropriate URL.
    I have commented out the initial RedirectResponse return for the endpoint,
    which can be changed and tested if deemed necessary.

##

#### üîù Limitations

-   For the scope of this project, a flat JSON file works fine; it's easy to
    implement and read/write from. In this context, a JSON file would become
    inefficient and slow at a few thousand entries, at which point, upgrading to
    a SQLite DB would be more appropriate. I have abstracted the file access to
    a separate file (storage.py), so implementing a DB wouldn't affect any of
    the current logic.

-   I used the `AnyHttpUrl` type provided by Pydantic to validate the format of
    the longUrl provided as the payload for the `/shorten` endpoint. I liked
    this approach since it offered consistent type-safety, has auto error codes
    and is easy to implement. It works well in this context, but if full control
    over what format of URL can be stored was needed, using a custom RegEx would
    be a better method. Or even better, a hybrid of a defined type and a RegEx
    could be used.

##

#### ‚ùó A Note on Exceptions

-   Originally, when the `shorten_and_save` function found a conflict in the
    stored URLs, I was simply raising a HTTPException, with a status_code (409)
    and some content. The same goes for the error handling function in
    `main.py`, which catches an error if the parsed URL does not meet the format
    defined in Pydantic's `AnyHttpUrl` type; a 422 response can be returned to
    signal a `Unprocessable Content` error. This is sufficient for the
    requirements of the API, but in order to better handle the errors on the
    Front End, I changed these HTTPExceptions to a JSONResponse, which still
    returns a HTTP code, which is seen in the console and terminal, but allows
    for more detailed content to be parsed and consumed in React. Since it
    returns a JSON object as the content, React can see the error detail I have
    typed out and render it on the Front End.

### üìÑ Context

This project was created as part of a technical task for a Junior Backend
Engineer role at Picnic in July 2025.

It‚Äôs intended to demonstrate my ability to understand requirements and implement
a REST API, with attention to HTTP standards, data persistence, and validation.

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Potential Future Updates

Given more time, I‚Äôd implement a SQLite database for scalability, stricter URL
formats using a RegEx, and expiry times for links. I'd also host it publicly.
